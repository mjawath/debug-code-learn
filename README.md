# Debug, Analyze, Code, Learn and Repeat

Welcome to the repository! This space serves as a companion for your learning journey on programming and technology concepts using Debug, Analyze, Code, Learn and Repeat methods.

## 🎯 Our Approach


At Code Debug, we believe in cycle- life itself a cycle:

1. **Debug**: Start with a working piece of code and start debugging
2. **Analyze**: Understand the issues, underlying principles and patterns
3. **Code**: Apply your knowledge to create new logics
4. **Learn**: Reflect on what you've discovered
5. **Repeat**: Continue the cycle to deepen your understanding

This approach, combined with our visual learning style, helps you:

- Gain practical experience from the start
- Develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills
- Build a robust understanding of programming concepts
- Continuously improve your coding abilities
